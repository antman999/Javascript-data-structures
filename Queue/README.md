## What is a Queue?
> A "FIFO" data structure, First In First Out. 
> The First element added will be the first removed. 
> Think about a line for a rollercoaster. The first in line will be the first in the ride and the last person that came will be the last in. 

## Why use a Queue?
 A - Because if you make a custom queue class you can make adding to the end and removing from the front better in time complexity.
## When not to use a Queue?
 A - If you dont need to constantly remove first from the front and push to the back.

## Time complexity of Queue
Need| Big O
------------ | -------------
Insertion | O(1)
Removal | O(1) 
Searching | O(N) Use array
Access | O(N) Use array
