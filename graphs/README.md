> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Why use a graph?
 A - A graph can be very useful to model many things such as users, data and connections. 

## Undirected and Directed graphs
1. A directed graph has pointers pointing to the next node or both. (Example - Twitter You can follow people and they can follow you back.)
