## What is a singly linked list?
> A data structure that holds information with methods 
> It contains a head, tail, and each is a node with a total length. 
> Each node has pointer to the next node which holds a value 

## Why use a singly linked list?
 A - Because it allows for much faster inserts/deletions than an array.

## Differences between a singly linked list and array
Singly Linked List | Array
------------ | -------------
No index | Indexed in order
Connected via nodes to the next pointer | insertion and deletion can be expensive
Random access is not allowed(must loop) | can be quickly accessed at any index
